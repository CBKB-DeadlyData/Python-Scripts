# DZS Zoomsounds Arbitrary File Read Recon Script

## Description
This Python script allows you to perform an unauthenticated reconnaissance scan for the DZS Zoomsounds Arbitrary File Read vulnerability (CVE-2021-39316). It prompts the user for a website, reads a list of directories from a file, and performs a series of CURL requests to check if the specified directories can be accessed on the target website. The script provides real-time verbose output, distinguishing between successful and failed requests.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- `curl` command-line tool
- `requests` library

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dzs-zoomsounds-recon.git
   cd dzs-zoomsounds-recon


## Install the required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Prepare the input files:
    Create a text file named afr.txt containing the directories to be tested (one directory per line).
    Replace the banner.png file with your own custom banner image (optional).

## Run the script:
python afr.py



Follow the instructions and enter the website URL when prompted.

View the real-time verbose output in the console.

The results will be saved to afr-results.txt, containing only the successful URLs.
